# Financial Market Sentiment Analysis
INTERNSHIP COMPANY - THE YBI FOUNDATION

I worked as Data Science Intern in YBI Foundation (July-August 2024). During my internship, I strengthened my skills in Machine Learrning,Predictive Analysis and Deep learning.

This project analyzes financial news headlines to predict market sentiment (Positive, Negative) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. The goal is to automate sentiment classification and provide insights into market trends.

I.Project Overview - 
Dataset: Financial news headlines with sentiment labels.
Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, NLP (CountVectorizer), Machine Learning.
Models Used: Multinomial Naive Bayes & Random Forest Classifier.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix.

II.Key Features : 
✔ Text preprocessing (tokenization, punctuation removal, vectorization).
✔ Sentiment classification using machine learning models.
✔ Performance comparison between Naive Bayes & Random Forest.
✔ Visualization of sentiment distribution.

III.Results & Insights : 
✅ Random Forest outperformed Naive Bayes with higher accuracy.
✅ Successfully automated financial sentiment classification.
✅ Potential for trend analysis in financial markets.

Contributions and improvements are welcome! 🚀
